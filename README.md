# UpdateLayerRefs
Mass update layer references from one database to another. This saves the hassle of manually going through each layer and revising its path. Use a JSON file to configure to a new database, as well as save a new copy of your MXD.

THIS TOOL IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, AND WILL BE PRODUCTION-READY SOON. ;)

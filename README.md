# UpdateLayerRefs
Mass update layer references from one database to another in a given mxd. This saves the hassle of manually going through each layer and revising its path. Use a JSON file to configure to a new database, as well as save a new copy of your MXD.

Future improvements planned:
Allow users to pass in multiple mxds as an array/tuple
Allow overwriting source mxd when fixing links
Create an ArcToolbox with an easy-to-use tool within ArcMap
